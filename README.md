#AI-Fake-NEWS-Detector

1.Overview
  This project aims to develop an AI-based system to detect fake news using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). The model is trained on labeled news 
  articles and predicts whether a news statement is real or fake. Several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier, are 
  implemented and compared to identify the most accurate model.

2.Features
  Text preprocessing using NLP (stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
  Feature extraction with TF-IDF Vectorization
  Implementation of multiple ML models
  Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
  Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
